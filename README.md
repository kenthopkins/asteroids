Asteroids clone with NASA Spitzer backgrounds

This is a learning project I am creating in GameMaker Studio 2 to help me with two goals.

1) To understand some of the changes in GML scripting from GM 1.4 to the current version.  As many of you already know, there have been several commands fro GM 1.4 which have been obsoleted in the new version.  

2) To quite simply carry a project out from start to end.  I have already done what so many beginning hobbyist game developers do and that is to begin and abandon (more than one now) game project.  I hope to actually finish this one, so wish me luck!  :)
